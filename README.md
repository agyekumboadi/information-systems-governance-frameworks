# Information Systems Governance Frameworks (Regulated UK Environment)

This repository demonstrates applied Information Systems Governance work in a regulated operational context, with emphasis on GDPR-aligned controls, risk management, auditability, and practical governance improvements.

The artefacts are presented as a transparent, reviewable record of governance analysis translated into operational controls and documentation. Organisation-specific sensitive details are excluded.

## Verification snapshot (release)

A stable snapshot of this repository (structure + artefacts) is available here:

Release: https://github.com/agyekumboadi/information-systems-governance-frameworks/releases/tag/v1.0-verification-snapshot

## What this repository demonstrates

This work shows my ability to:
1. identify governance and operational risks across real workflows and systems usage
2. map risks to practical controls, policies, and accountability structures
3. align controls to GDPR principles and regulated environment expectations
4. document improvements clearly so non-technical stakeholders can verify and act on them

## Repository structure

- `evidence/report/` contains the case study report (PDF)
- `evidence/slides/` contains the supporting slide deck (PDF)
- `docs/` contains supporting materials (for example: diagrams or notes), where applicable

## Key evidence artefacts

Report (PDF): `evidence/report/IS_Governance_Case_Study_Report.pdf`  
Slides (PDF): `evidence/slides/IS_Governance_Framework_Slides.pdf`

If file names change, the latest versions can always be found inside the `evidence/` folder.

## How to verify quickly

1. Open the report in `evidence/report/` and review the governance analysis, risks, and control recommendations.
2. Open the slides in `evidence/slides/` for a high-level summary of the same work.
3. Confirm consistency across report and slides, and verify the repository structure and documentation.
