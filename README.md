# Information Systems Governance Frameworks (Regulated UK Environment)

This repository provides evidence of my applied Information Systems Governance capability in a regulated operational environment, with a focus on GDPR-aligned controls, risk management, auditability, and practical governance improvements.

It is included in my Tech Nation evidence pack as a verifiable technical record of governance thinking translated into operational controls and documentation.

## What this repository proves

This work demonstrates how I:
1. Identify governance and security risks in real operational workflows
2. Map risks to practical controls, policies, and accountability structures
3. Align controls to GDPR principles and regulated practice expectations
4. Document improvements clearly for verification by non-technical stakeholders

## Evidence included in this repository

This repo contains governance evidence such as:
- a structured governance analysis and findings
- practical controls and improvement recommendations
- supporting diagrams or screenshots where appropriate

Note: organisation-specific sensitive information is excluded. The focus is on governance methods, control thinking, and auditable documentation.

## How to verify quickly

1. Start with the report artefact(s) in this repository (PDF / slides if included).
2. Review diagrams and workflow evidence showing how governance is applied to operational systems.
3. Confirm the repository structure and documentation quality via README and committed artefacts.
